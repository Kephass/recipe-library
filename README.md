# Recipe App

A recipe app designed to allow users to quickly and easily find, save, and share recipes.

## Overview

This is a simple React application created primarily for learning purposes. It _will_ include the ability to fetch a random recipe, retrieve a list of recipes based on various criterias (such as its cuisine type), and save recipes to a list of favorites.

## To-Do List

The following are some tasks that still need to be completed, as well as questions that still need to be answered:

- Make the user's profile picture more responsive
  - Perhaps disappear entirely at smaller screen sizes
- The RecommendationMeal is also very unresponsive on mobile views
- The Search Results screen is very incomplete
